# Game-of-Life-Simulation

This is my version of John Conway's Game of Life using matplotlib and numpy for the simulation. You are able to add commonly found patterns into the simulation and read in patterns through a text file. You will also be able to pause or resume the simulation by pressing the space bar. You can click ON or OFF cells depending on their activity state while the simulation is paused to create your own patterns.
